 ### How to play with the endpoint 
 ## Example
 If I run
    ```
    curl YOUR_URL?board=+xxo++o++
    ```
I should get the exact string oxxo  o   (thatâ€™s o-x-x-o-space-space-o-space-space) as the entire contents of the HTTP response body. If your api returns anything else, our unit tests will fail when run on your code.
